This application was created as a platform to share WildAid Marine's data with stakeholders, partners, and donors. It includes an interactive map that displays information and motivation for conservation across all of our sites, filterable and searchable tables of the data for interactive data exploration, and user-input defined plots that can be used for comparing sites across years or category scores across sites. 

This application was created by Jared Petry, Elise Gonzales, Adelaide Robinson, and Kiran Favre. This is part of their masters capstone project as 2023 graduates of the Masters of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, University of California Santa Barbara.
