Marine protected areas (MPAs) have extensive benefits, both to ecosystems and communities (FAO 2020). However, more than half of all MPAs lack necessary enforcement (Edgar et al. 2014), which leads to communities losing billions of dollars to illegal fishing each year (Agnew et al. 2009). WildAid Marine seeks to give fishing communities the tools they need to enforce their fishing regulations for the benefit of their communities and the health of the ecosystems that support them.
