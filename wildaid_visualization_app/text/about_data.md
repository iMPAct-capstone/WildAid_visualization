With the goal of quantifying, monitoring, and ultimately improving the enforcement of MPAs, WildAid Marine created the Marine Protection System (MPS) Tracker. This tracking system is a unique way of measuring various metrics of enforcement performance of a marine protected area or fishery. Project managers assess their local areas by scoring the enforcement system to better understand where they may be lacking,  and accordingly develop a complete multi-year MPS Plan. Here, you can explore the raw data in the "Explore Data" tab, and see the average scores in the "Summary Table" tab, while filtering for the desired site and year.
