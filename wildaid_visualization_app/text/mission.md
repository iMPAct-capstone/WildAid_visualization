Our Mission: 

  WildAid Marine designs and applies effective enforcement solutions to deter illegal fishing and strengthen the protection of priority marine areas. 
  
  Well-enforced marine protected areas (MPAs) and fisheries are one of the best conservation tools we have to protect our oceans. Unfortunately, nearly 60 percent of designated MPAs lack the resources needed to provide real protection for ecosystems and wildlife.
  
  WildAid Marine is working hard to make the promise of marine protection real. Over the next five years, our goal is to enroll 250 marine areas in our BLUEPRINT for Marine Protectionâ„¢ to improve enforcement and achieve meaningful marine conservation at scale.
